# Killing_Weed_Robot
It's an autonomous robot used in the agriculture field for killing weeds between crops, 
there is a Module used to detect weeds using image Processing and Embedded systems,
Camera is used in the module to detect the position of each weed, 
then send the position to the AVR microcontroller to decide which valve will open through the relays to kill the weed using pesticides. 
OpenCV is used in image processing and UART peripheral is used in the AVR microcontroller to receive the position of each weed.
